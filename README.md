AI PROMPT:
I am creating a desktop app called "Streamline" 
the aim is to make music production simpler and more accessible. AI will be a huge major part of this project. DAWs like logic pro and fl studio require too much knowledge to use the complicated softwares, and there are too many buttons. Very redundant. I want AI to do all the unnecessary stuff. I also want to use AI completely free of cost for me. Another goal is to simplify all controls to make them more intuitive for the user. AI will continualy assist in teaching the user music theroy and the app itself. AI should keep track of user behavior in order to suggest instruments, loops, etc. One major thing is to avoid the music being "ai-generated" AI is simply an assisstant, removing the obstacles between creative musical ideas and the product. I want electron frontend and flask backend.
