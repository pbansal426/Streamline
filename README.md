# Streamline: A Beginner-Friendly Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)

## **Problem Definition**

### **Problem Statement**
Current Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Logic Pro and FL Studio, while feature-rich, have a steep learning curve that can intimidate beginners. Many aspiring producers struggle with navigating these platforms due to technical jargon, cluttered interfaces, and the absence of intuitive guidance.  

**Key Question:**  
How can we create a DAW that simplifies the music production process while still offering powerful tools for beginners to learn, experiment, and grow?

### **Background**
- Popular DAWs such as Logic Pro and Ableton Live offer robust functionality but require significant time and expertise to master.
- Many beginner-friendly tools lack flexibility or omit advanced features entirely, alienating users as they progress.
- Educational research highlights the importance of interactive learning in software tools, showing that users retain knowledge better when they are guided and can experiment dynamically.

Streamline aims to bridge this gap by offering an AI-powered DAW that simplifies workflows, explains concepts interactively, and helps users learn music production as they create.

## **AI Integration Plan**

### **Role of AI**
Streamline integrates AI to assist users in the following ways:
- **Project Initialization:** Generate track layouts and settings based on user prompts. For example, a user can specify, "I want a slow rock song with acoustic instruments."
- **Real-Time Feedback:** AI detects issues (e.g., EQ imbalances, clipping) and suggests corrections with easy-to-understand explanations.
- **Interactive Guidance:** Tooltips and dynamic tutorials appear as users interact with various elements, teaching them concepts like reverb, EQ, and spatial audio.
- **Loop and Asset Recommendations:** The AI curates loops, samples, and instruments, reducing the need for manual selection while allowing modifications.

### **Techniques & Frameworks**
- **AI Recommendations and Natural Language Processing:** Utilizing OpenAI APIs or similar tools for prompt-based initialization and dynamic tutorials.
- **Audio Processing:** Libraries such as `howler.js` (frontend) and backend systems to manage sound rendering.
- **Interactive Education:** Custom algorithms to detect user struggles and provide tailored guidance.
