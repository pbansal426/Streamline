# Streamline

Project: Streamline, a Digital Audio Workstation that is designed to make music production easier.

Will use Django for backend and Electron for frontend

Many python libraries such as tensorflow and soundfile will be used for AI implementation and audio related functions. 


Research:
Many DAWs such as Logic Pro, FL Studio, Ableton, are expensive to obtain and have a steep learning curve and need for music theory knowledge. Lots of different elements such as MIDI, Equalizer settings, reverb, synthesizers, loops, regions, tracks, etc can be very difficult to grasp without proper education/lessons.

I am calling it Streamline. since it  boasts "quick learning" and also since it sounds cool

AI will assist the user all the time when using the app, and will teach them music theory as they make music. Most features on normal DAWs that have lots of buttons and technical terms will be simplified and AI - assisted
